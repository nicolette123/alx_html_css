# Figma Familiarization Task (Task 0)

## 🧠 Overview
This task is designed to help me become familiar with **Figma**, understand the design structure, and prepare for the upcoming web development implementation. The main objective is to review the provided design, duplicate it into my own Figma workspace, and document the key design properties and behaviors.

---

## 🚀 Steps Completed

1. **Created a Figma Account**
   - Signed up at [https://www.figma.com](https://www.figma.com) and logged into my workspace.

2. **Opened and Duplicated the Design File**
   - Accessed the provided Figma link and selected **“Duplicate to my Drafts”** to have my own editable copy.
   - If the file wasn’t accessible, I used the provided `.fig` file and imported it by dragging it into my Figma dashboard.

3. **Installed Required Fonts**
   - Downloaded and installed:
     - `Source Sans Pro`
     - `Spin Cycle OT`
   - Restarted Figma to apply these fonts.

4. **Reviewed Design Details**
   - Analyzed the page layout, colors, typography, spacing, and components.
   - Noted responsive behavior and hover/active interactions.

## 🎨 Design & Interaction Notes

| Feature | Details |
|----------|----------|
| **Max Content Width** | 1000px, centered on the page |
| **Responsive Breakpoint** | Switches to mobile view when screen width ≤ **480px** |
| **Link Hover/Active Color** | `#FF6565` |
| **Button Hover/Active** | `opacity: 0.9` |
| **Primary Fonts** | Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT |

## 🧩 Figma Key Learnings
- How to navigate Figma (layers, components, and design frames)
- Inspecting spacing, colors, and typography for accurate frontend implementation
- Understanding responsive constraints for desktop and mobile views
- Preparing design assets for export

---

## 📦 Next Steps
- Implement the design in HTML/CSS/JS based on the Figma layout.
- Apply responsive behavior and hover states as defined.
- Ensure all fonts and assets match the design specifications.

---

## 💡 Notes
If any values in Figma are displayed as floats (e.g., `12.45px`), they can be safely rounded (e.g., `12px`).

### 🏁 Task Complete
This step ensures that I’m fully familiar with the design file and ready to start coding the layout in the next task.
